# Real-time-object-detection
Real-time object detection using Python and machine learning involves using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect
and recognize objects in real-time video streams or camera feeds. The goal is to identify and locate specific objects within the video frames as accurately
and efficiently as possible.

Computer vision is a branch of AI and machine learning
that focuses on giving computers the ability to interpret and
comprehend visual data from their surroundings. In order
for computers to evaluate, interpret, and extract valuable
information from digital photos and videos, algorithms and
models must be developed. Numerous businesses, including
healthcare, transportation, security, and entertainment, use
computer vision in diverse ways. Object identification, facial
recognition, autonomous cars, and medical imaging are a few
applications of computer vision. Computer vision is a growing
field with many interesting future prospects.

A key component of computer vision, object detection identifies the type and placement of objects in an image or video.
With the advent of deep learning-based models like YOLO
(You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks), object identification has growin significance
in recent years. Even in complex scenarios with
numerous objects and occlusions, these models can accurately
and effectively recognize objects in real-time. Applications for
object detection are numerous, ranging from robots and selfdriving cars to surveillance systems and imaging in the medical
field. Object detection is used in the healthcare industry to find
anomalies in medical imaging. Among many other uses, the
technology is employed in activity recognition and pedestrian
detection. Overall,In general, object detection is a critical
technology that has the capacity to completely transform a
variety of fields and sectors.
