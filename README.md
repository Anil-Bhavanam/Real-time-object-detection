# Real-time-object-detection
Real-time object detection using Python and machine learning involves using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect
and recognize objects in real-time video streams or camera feeds. The goal is to identify and locate specific objects within the video frames as accurately
and efficiently as possible.
